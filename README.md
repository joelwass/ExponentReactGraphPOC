# ExponentReactGraphPOC
Project using <a href="https://getexponent.com/">Exponent.js</a> for React-Native development.

This was a test for creating the home screen graphs of VersaMe's mobile application. It was intended to test both the viability of using Exponent for production development, and the viability of using React-Native for production development.

Feel free to use any and all code.
